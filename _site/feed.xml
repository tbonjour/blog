&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into as much detail as a SRS. For now, I will list a bunch of features I would like in my blog (or website) and then we’ll go from there. Whenever I add a feature I will scratch out the list item - and ideally point to a post (mine or external) that talks about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Differentiate between different types of posts. For instance, keep the technical blog posts separate from the personal posts.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Toggle dark mode.&lt;/del&gt; Add a toggle button instead of text link.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; page. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://sive.rs/nowff&quot;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe also have a page that lists my current (personal) projects and what I would like to work on in the future.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nownownow.com/about&quot;&gt;nownownow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a tags page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a dark-mode for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trevorbonjour.me&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;O Me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,&lt;br /&gt;
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,&lt;br /&gt;
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)&lt;br /&gt;
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,&lt;br /&gt;
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,&lt;br /&gt;
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,&lt;br /&gt;
The question, O me! so sad, recurring - What good amid these, O me, O life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Answer.&lt;br /&gt;
That you are here—that life exists and identity,&lt;br /&gt;
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I just wanted to have a way of converting simple text or markdown files to HTML directly, so I wouldn’t have to deal with the HTML syntax. And EUREKA! I had a great idea - Why not develop some software that would take some form of rich text and convert it to HTML. And as every software project starts - with a search - I ventured out in the vast spaces of the internet to see if someone had done something similar - and low and behold - who do we have here - Jekyll!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Using Jekyll is straightforward - or so I was told by the numerous blogs I read. I guess if one doesn&apos;t know YAML, Ruby etc. the folder structure, the syntax, the inner workings of Jekyll are not very intuitive. Maybe it was my approach - diving right into the deepend - that caused me to flutter more than I would have if I took a more structured approach. Well, who&apos;s to know what could have been.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categories-in-jekyll&quot;&gt;Categories in Jekyll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a post under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;techinal/_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder. Jekyll automatically recognizes directory above &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; as a category. Maybe I’ll write a longer post on this in the future - once I understand Jekyll better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simon Dosda’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://simondosda.github.io/posts/2021-09-13-blog-github-pages-1-introduction.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; was helpful to start out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you feel lost amongst the numerous files and folders Jekyll’s documentation is a good place to start to understand all the moving parts. If I were to start over - I would start &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If nothing else, you’ll understand what this &lt;em&gt;Front Matter&lt;/em&gt; is everyone keeps mentioning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want to toggle dark and light mode? Head over to Derek Kedziora’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://derekkedziora.com/blog/dark-mode-revisited&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. I like his webpage - will steal - sorry I mean - will borrow more from there in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are categories? Aren’t they the same as tags? No? Huh! Well to get a better understanding head back to Jekyll’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. Multi-blog site? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garron.me/en/blog/multi-blog-site-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;Guillermo Garron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.yfei.page/en/2019/02/how-to-create-multiple-pages-in-blog-style-with-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Fie Ye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another helpful/playful resource I stumbled upon was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/&quot;&gt;Webjeda&lt;/a&gt; created by Sharath Kumar. Will be revisting often to borrow of course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few other interesting sources that I have not really digged into. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomcritchlow.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Critchlow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
