title:  "Why Jekyll?"

Well to be honest, I did not know Jekyll existed. I just wanted to have a way of converting simple text or markdown files to HTML directly, so I wouldn't have to deal with the HTML syntax. And EUREKA! I had a great idea - Why not develop some software that would take some form of rich text and convert it to HTML. And as every software project starts - with a search - I ventured out in the vast spaces of the internet to see if someone had done something similar - and low and behold - who do we have here - Jekyll!

<!-- Using Jekyll is straightforward - or so I was told by the numerous blogs I read. I guess if one doesn't know YAML, Ruby etc. the folder structure, the syntax, the inner workings of Jekyll are not very intuitive. Maybe it was my approach - diving right into the deepend - that caused me to flutter more than I would have if I took a more structured approach. Well, who's to know what could have been.

#### Categories in Jekyll
This is a post under `techinal/_posts` folder. Jekyll automatically recognizes directory above `_posts` as a category. Maybe I'll write a longer post on this in the future - once I understand Jekyll better.

2. When you feel lost amongst the numerous files and folders Jekyll's documentation is a good place to start to understand all the moving parts. If I were to start over - I would start [here]. If nothing else, you'll understand what this *Front Matter* is everyone keeps mentioning.

4. What are categories? Aren't they the same as tags? No? Huh! Well to get a better understanding head back to Jekyll's [docs]. Multi-blog site? [Guillermo Garron], [Fie Ye]
