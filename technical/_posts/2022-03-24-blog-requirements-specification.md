Just like we have a software requirements specifications (SRS), this is a living BRS - blog requirements specifications. 

I won't go into as much detail as a SRS. For now, I will list a bunch of features I would like in my blog (or website) and then we'll go from there. Whenever I add a feature I will scratch out the list item - and ideally point to a post (mine or external) that talks about the process.

### Requirements:
1. ~~Differentiate between different types of posts. For instance, keep the technical blog posts separate from the personal posts.~~
2. ~~Toggle dark mode.~~ Add a toggle button instead of text link. 
3. Add a `now` page. Inspired by [Derek Sivers]. Maybe also have a page that lists my current (personal) projects and what I would like to work on in the future. 
    1. Get listed on [nownownow].
4. Add a tags page.
5. Create a dark-mode for the [website].
